# Creating a Movable Element

_Greetings JavaScript enthusiasts,_

In this assignment, let's dive into the practical side of JavaScript by crafting a movable HTML element. Your task is to enable the element to smoothly navigate the browser canvas. The specifications are straightforward:

### Functionality:

Arrow Key Navigation: Implement the ability to move the element in four directions – up, down, left, and right – using the arrow keys.

Click-to-Position: Allow the user to relocate the element instantly by clicking anywhere on the page.

### Implementation Tips:

Utilize `addEventListener()` to capture arrow key and click events.
Apply `position: absolute` to grant the element full freedom of movement.

### Optional Challenges:

Feel free to enhance your implementation with optional features:

- Ensure the element stays within the visible screen area.
- Implement collision detection or introduce obstacles for added complexity.

### Styling:

While the primary focus is on functionality, you have the liberty to style the element according to your preferences. A simple black square suffices, but feel free to inject your creativity into the design.

### Task Overview:

Set up event listeners for arrow keys and mouse clicks.
Implement logic to update the element's position based on the events.
Optionally add extra features or constraints to elevate the challenge.
Remember, this exercise aims to reinforce your understanding of event handling and manipulation of HTML elements using JavaScript. Keep your code organized, and have a smooth coding journey! If you find yourself in need of a loop, use the opportunity to practice the high level array methods we looked at during the last lecture.

**Remember to enable GitHub Pages on your submission**

Best of luck on your coding adventure!
